## This is my first blog post!

I've always wanted to blog online and host something that was authentic to me. 
Then, I met a supportive person coincidentally at the basketball courts in a local park.
He inspired me by showing me that he hosts his own.

As someone who is not a cs major and did not have github until this day; the act of posting blogs and having proof that I am writing on a .io platform is something I can call my own and refer back to.
By researching topics on navigating career as someone in their 20s, building relationships, creating good habits, reaching financial goals, and taking steps to better myself has given me routine.
Routine is very important especially has a new grad. Waking up at the same time, eating around the same time, contributing to your learning, actively practicing your goals eases the anxeity.
When I say anxiety I dont mean as a mental health disorder, I'm talking about that feeling of being overwhelmed knowing that what you want and how you get is completely up to you.
